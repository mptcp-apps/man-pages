.SH NAME
mptcp \- Multipath TCP protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.B #include <netinet/in.h>
.B #ifndef IPPROTO_MPTCP
.B #define IPPROTO_MPTCP 262

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an implementation of the Multipath TCP extension to the
TCP protocol defined in RFC\ 8684. Like
.BR tcp (7),
Multipath TCP provides a bidirectional reliable bytestream. The
key difference between
.BR tcp (7)
and
.BR mptcp (7)
is that the latter allows the packets to be spread over different paths.
.PP
Multipath TCP is compatible with both versions 4 and 6 of
.BR ip (7) .
A client creates an outgoing Multipath TCP connection using the
.BR connect (2)
system call on a Multipath TCP socket created as shown above.
Similarly, a server needs to
.BR bind (2)
a Multipath TCP socket before calling
.BR listen (2)
and then
.BR accept (2)
to accept incoming connections.
.PP
Linux only supports version 1 of the Multipath TCP protocol
defined in RFC\ 8684. Off-tree patches are available to
support the version of the protocol defined in RFC\ 6824.
.PP
Multipath TCP transports the data belonging to one Multipath TCP
connection over different paths by using one TCP connection, called
subflow, over which of these paths. These subflows are managed by
the path manager, see
.BR ip-mptcp (8) .
The packet scheduler schedules the data over the active subflows
of a Multipath TCP connection.
.SS
/proc interfaces
Multipath TCP exposes several system-wide parameters in
directory
.IR /proc/sys/net/mptcp . See also the /proc interface of
.BR tcp (7) .
Variables described as
.I Boolean
take an integer value, with a nonzero value ("true") meaning that
the corresponding option is enabled, and a zero value ("false")
meaning that the option is disabled.
.TP
.IR enabled " (Boolean; default: 1; from Linux 5.13+)"
Allows the creation of Multipath TCP sockets if the value is 1.
This is a per-namespace sysctl.
.TP
.IR checksum_enabled " (Boolean; default: 0; from Linux 5.14+) "
Allows the utilization of the Multipath TCP DSS checksum defined
in RFC\ 8684. This checksum improves resilience to middlebox
interference but increases CPU load. This is a per-namespace sysctl.
.TP
.IR add_addr_timeout " (Integer; default: 120; from Linux 5.13) "
Timeout (in seconds) after which an unacknowledged ADD_ADDR control message
will be resent. This is a per-namespace sysctl.
.IR stale_loss_cnt " (Integer; default: 4; from Linux 5.16) "
The number of retransmission intervals with no traffic to declare
a subflow as stale. The packet scheduler ignores the stale
subflows. This is a per-namespace sysctl.
.SS Socket options
Multipath TCP usually passes the TCP socket options on the different
subflows that compose a Multipath TCP connection. The following
TCP socket options are supported by Multipath TCP. See
.BR tcp (7)
for additional information about them.

calls :

.TP
.SH ERRORS
The
.BR socket (2)
call can return two errors that are specific to
.BR mptcp (7) .
.TP
.B EPROTONOSUPPORT
Indicates that the Multipath TCP protocol is not implemented.
.TP
.B ENOPROTOOPT
Indicates that Multipath TCP is disabled on this host.
